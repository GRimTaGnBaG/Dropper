# Drone Dropper and Crane System

This project adds remote-controlled payload dropper attachments to drones using **ESP32** microcontrollers, **LoRa** modules, and servo motors.  
It supports two system types:

1. **Dropper Attachment** â€“ a simple payload release system.  
2. **Dropper + Crane Attachment** â€“ an extended system with a crane to lower and release payloads.  

Both systems consist of paired Arduino sketches: one for the drone, and one for the base station.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

### ðŸ”¹ Dropper Attachment (simple release system)
- **AT-Drone/AT-Drone.ino**  
  Runs on the droneâ€™s ESP32.  
  - Listens for **AT commands** from the base station via LoRa.  
  - Controls a servo to release the payload.  
  - Lightweight and minimal â€” best if you just need a simple drop mechanism.  

- **BaseStationAT/BaseStationAT.ino**  
  Runs on the ground/base station ESP32.  
  - Sends AT commands to the drone to trigger the drop.  
  - Provides the operator with a simple control interface.

### ðŸ”¹ Dropper + Crane Attachment (advanced system)
- **DroneCrane/DroneCrane.ino**  
  Runs on the droneâ€™s ESP32.  
  - Controls a **servo-driven crane mechanism** to lower, lift, and release payloads.  
  - Handles LoRa messages from the crane station.  
  - Includes logic for safety and servo positioning.  

- **Cranestation/Cranestation.ino**  
  Runs on the ground/base station ESP32.  
  - Sends commands to the DroneCrane via LoRa.  
  - Lets the operator control the crane arm (raise, lower, drop).  
  - Provides more flexibility than the simple dropper.

## ðŸ›  Hardware Requirements
- **ESP32 development boards**  
- **LoRa RYLR998/498 modules**  
- **Servos** (for dropper or crane mechanism)  
- **3D-printed attachment** for drone mounting  
- DJI Mini (or similar drone) for integration

## ðŸš€ Usage
1. Choose your system type:  
   - **Dropper** â†’ flash `AT-Drone.ino` (drone) and `BaseStationAT.ino` (base station).  
   - **Dropper + Crane** â†’ flash `DroneCrane.ino` (drone) and `Cranestation.ino` (base station).  

2. Open Arduino IDE or PlatformIO.  
3. Select **ESP32 board** and correct COM port.  
4. Upload the sketch to each ESP32.  
5. Power on the base station and drone modules â€” youâ€™re ready to drop or crane!
